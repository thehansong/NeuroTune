# 🎯 NeuroTune - AI-Enhanced Aim Trainer

## 🎮 Training your aim, one adaptive target at a time  
**NeuroTune** is an AI-driven aim trainer that adapts in real-time to improve your FPS skills by dynamically adjusting the size, spawn location, and lifetime of targets based on your performance.

## 💡 Inspiration  
As competitive gaming and eSports gain momentum, we recognized a gap in personalized training tools. Traditional aim trainers like **Aim Lab** and **Kovaak's** offer great scenarios, but they lack real-time adaptability and personalization. **NeuroTune** was conceived to bridge this gap by leveraging cutting-edge AI to offer a training experience that adjusts in real-time, offering unprecedented personalization that hasn't yet been seen in commercially available trainers.

- **Adaptive Training**: Real-time adjustments of target size, spawn location, and lifetime based on player performance.
- **Fitts' Law Integration**: Uses Fitts' Law to create a training environment that adjusts difficulty dynamically.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: to add @mark
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks hits, misses, and reaction times to optimize future training sessions.

## 🔧 How we built it  
- **App/Trainer**: Built using **Unity** for 3D environments and **Python** for the AI-driven components.  
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning algorithms analyze player performance to adjust difficulty in real-time.  
- **Fitts' Law**: Implemented as the core mechanic to control target behavior based on distance, size, and player response time.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into  
We faced difficulties integrating Fitts' Law into a real-time system, as calculating dynamic target parameters while ensuring smooth gameplay required careful balancing. Additionally, creating an adaptive system that doesn't frustrate users while remaining challenging proved to be a balancing act.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We successfully implemented real-time adaptability that provides meaningful and tailored training sessions. We also received positive feedback from initial testers, who saw significant improvement in their aiming accuracy after just a week of using NeuroTune.

## What we learned  
We learned the value of combining machine learning with game mechanics to create more personalized experiences. Additionally, we gained deeper insights into how principles like Fitts' Law can be applied to enhance user interaction in a game environment.

## What's next for NeuroTune  
NeuroTune serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of AI-driven adaptability in aim training applications. As of August 2024, this project showcases an innovative approach that has not yet been implemented in any commercial aim trainer on the market. While we plan to refine the machine learning algorithms to provide even more precise adaptability based on user performance, the current implementation serves primarily to validate the concept.

## 🌟 Fun Fact  
During our final testing phase, one of our playtesters experienced such a drastic improvement in their aim that they managed to hit a record Kills Per Minute (KPM) in **Counter-Strike 2** after just one week of training with NeuroTune!
